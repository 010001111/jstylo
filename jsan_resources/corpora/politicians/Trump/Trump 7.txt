THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS WAS AN AMAZING EVENING. THIS WAS A GREAT EVENING. THEY JUST ANNOUNCED NORTH CAROLINA. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED ILLINOIS YET BUT WE ARE LEADING BY A LOT. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO ANNOUNCE IT. FLORIDA IS SO AMAZING. I WANT TO THANK OUR FRIENDS. WE PICKED UP NINE DELEGATES THIS MORNING. I HEARD VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING. THAT IS A LOT. I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE GOVERNOR, RALPH HALL AS, CHAIRMAN ATTA, THAT WAS A NICE START TO THE DAY. MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE POLL SAID 49% TO 14%. WE JUST HAD ONE FROM THE ECONOMIST WHO JUST CAME OUT. 53%. I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS AND ONE OF THE COMMENTATORS I'M NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF SAID DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T GET OVER 50% BECAUSE I MET 43. 45. NOW I MET 53. I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THESE PEOPLE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND BASIC PHYSICS, BASIC MATHEMATICS. WHEN I DON'T GET OVER 50% WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? WHEN I GET 53 PERCENT, THAT IS WITH FOUR PEOPLE. THAT IS AN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT MATHEMATICALLY WHEN YOU CAN GET OVER 50 PERCENT. [APPLAUSE] SOMEDAY THEY ARE GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE TAKE IT ALL. THEY WILL UNDERSTAND. I WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD. [APPLAUSE] YVONNEIVANKA IS HOME RIGHT NOW. SHE IS READY TO HAVE THE BABY. WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. SHE HAS BEEN SO HELPFUL. JARRETT HAS BEEN AMAZING. I WANT TO THANK BARON FOR THING UP WITH THE FACT THAT I NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE. I NEVER SEE HIM. IT IS HIS BIRTHDAY. HE SAYS WHEN YOU COMING HOME? IN ABOUT TWO AND A HALF WEEKS, IT IS PRETTY TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING ALL OVER THE PLACE. I WENT UP TO YOUNGSTOWN, WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE CROWD NADAND JUST AMAZING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. IF SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE. WE WILL, SOMEDAY IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE, OTHERWISE IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT APPLE AND ALL THESE GREAT COMPANIES WILL BE MAKING THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. NOT IN CHINA, VIETNAM, AND ALL OVER.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOSING OUR COUNTRY -- OUR COMPANIES ARE LEAVING RAPIDLY. WHETHER IT IS FORD, EATON, I WAS IN CLEVELAND, AND EATON CORP IS LEAVING FOR STUFF, I'M DISGUSTED WITH IT. I AM TIRED OF IT, THERE IS NO REASON FORT. IT IS GROSS INCOMPETENCE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. PFIZER, GREAT COMPANY, THEY'RE GOING TO IRELAND. THERE IS SO MNANY MORE, YOUR CORPORATE INVERSIONS. THEY CAN GET THE MONEY BECAUSE THE POLITICIANS CAN'T GET ALONG, CAN'T MAKE A DEAL FOR THE EVERYBODY AGREES, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, THAT THE MONEY SHOULD COME BACK. THERE IS TWO POINT $5 TRILLION OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE HERE. 

WE CAN MAKE A DEAL, THERE IS NOT EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IF I SAT DOWN WITH A FEW THE SENATORS, AND THE CONGRESSMAN, YOU CAN MAKE IT BACK IN 10 MINUTES IF HE KNEW YOU WERE DOING. EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO IT. COMPANIES ARE LEAVING OUR COUNTRY TO GET THERE MONEY. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OUR TAXES ARE TOO HIGH -- WHICH WILL LOWER, BY THE WAY -- BUT THEY'RE LEAVING IN ORDER TO GO AND GET MONEY THAT IS THEIR MONEY BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY OF BRINGING IT IN. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. AT SOME POINT, IT IS GOING TO GET DONE. THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN VERY EXCITING. I WAS ONE OF 17 PEOPLE WHEN WE STARTED. SENATORS, GOVERNORS, I'VE HAD SUCH GREAT SUPPORT. DR. BEN CARSON THE OTHER DAY ENDORSED US. GREAT GUY, GREAT GUY, WONDERFUL MAN. AND CHRIS CHRISTIE ENDORSED US, THAT WAS SO INCREDIBLE.
